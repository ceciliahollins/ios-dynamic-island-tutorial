# ios-dynamic-island-tutorial
A project to practice and demonstrate functionality of iOS Live Activities framework and SwiftUI

## Description
This project is intended for learning and practicing ActivityKit, a framework that allows live updates in the Dynamic Island and Lock Screen. Live Activities allow for real time updates of your data in a quick and glanceable manner. Live Activities are similar to widgets, except that widgets create a timeline of updates while Live Activities are updated based on new data.

It is important to have an understanding of WidgetKit and widgets design and development, as Live Activites are an extenstion to widgets. To learn about widgets, view the authors [iOS Widgets tutorial](https://github.com/ceciliahollins/ios-widgets-tutorial)

### Executing program
